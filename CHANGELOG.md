# Changelog

## 0.1.2 — 2026-10-17

- Add owned bomb placement after movement, one live bomb per player, captured range,
  and 180-tick detonation deadlines. Fuse execution follows in the next increment.
- Resolve eligible simultaneous placements deterministically; failed requests consume
  no capacity or entity ID and never carry into another tick.
- Preserve collision grace for every overlapping player until they leave the bomb.
- Replace the unused ownerless obstacle API with `InputAction::PlaceBomb`.

This remains a headless engineering prerelease. Explosions, damage, and browser play
are not implemented yet.

## 0.1.1 — 2026-10-17

- Verify the Rust/React foundation, locked builds, coverage, dependency/image scans,
  Docker Compose, and local Kubernetes operation.
- Add the deterministic headless arena/movement model, turn assistance, logical input
  priority, swept collision, bomb exit exemptions, and repeatable state comparisons.
- Specify the classic two-player rules and phased implementation plan.
- Select PixiJS for future arena rendering alongside the React/Mantine interface.

This engineering prerelease has no playable browser arena or combat yet. The browser
continues to expose transport diagnostics. See `docs/verification.md` for observed results.
