This archive preserves the older release records originally maintained in
[`docs/releases.md`](../releases.md). Records remain in their original order; the current
release procedure and current release record stay in the [release guide](../releases.md).

## v0.3.59 — 2026-10-25

[v0.3.59](https://github.com/liveweird/grenadiers/releases/tag/v0.3.59) generates browser item
catalogs from each v7–v11 schema's own `ItemId` enum. Live settings and validation reuse those
tuples; retained validators preserve their narrower activation subsets. V2–v6 generated output,
schema JSON, standalone validators, rules, generation, replay identities and dependencies are
unchanged. An E2E privacy assertion now checks the actual unique secret and redaction markers
rather than rejecting a harmless `/private/tmp` checkout path; sanitizer behavior is unchanged.

Application inputs match `473d1e6e889cfecd5c08178f3b881ca74d775fae`; later source adds only the
E2E test correction and release documentation. Accepted image is
`sha256:946a5f6fbab0c8b573c66badff34157b445cc57cc65798d519bc7fdc6a303fc0`.
Independent catalog review is clear. Fresh full web acceptance passes 6,799 tests / 88 files
in 314.30s; coverage is 90.94/89.49/89.85/93.30% above the unchanged floors. Production gzip
JavaScript/CSS sizes are 336,404/36,292 bytes. All retained generation/standalone drift checks,
API conventions, lint, unused-code, repository and corrected full E2E static checks pass.

Rust behavior is unchanged: reuse v0.3.58's complete 4,194,304-mask debug/release/official-coverage
acceptance (93.50% application lines), plus its shutdown and separate graphics diagnostics.
Dependency inputs are unchanged, so v0.3.57's fresh Cargo-deny and both zero-finding npm audits
remain applicable. The exact new image receives its own scan and runtime acceptance below.

Fresh pinned Trivy 0.74.0 acceptance reports zero fixable HIGH/CRITICAL vulnerabilities.
Native Chromium passes eight default cases through Compose (36.4s) and eight through Kubernetes
(40.3s), with unchanged assertions and no configured retries. The first Kubernetes setup used an
8085 origin allowlist with a browser on 18086; correcting only that isolated environment fixed
session admission. Its original failure log was overwritten; the verifier's command-output
excerpt is retained as a limitation. The initial scan lacked Docker socket access; the corrected
exact-image scan is authoritative. Health/readiness, runtime security and CSP/cache headers pass.

Localhost:8085 now serves that accepted image. Promotion verifies exact HTML/JavaScript/atlas
bytes against the local build and image, runtime security, headers and one additional native
realtime smoke. Temporary acceptance services, namespaces and forwards are removed. Control is
`.local-checkpoints/runtime/compose-v0.3.59.yaml`; `rollback-v0.3.58.yaml` retains the previous
image. No migration or gameplay configuration change is introduced by this release.

## v0.3.58 — 2026-10-25

[v0.3.58](https://github.com/liveweird/grenadiers/releases/tag/v0.3.58) bounds HTTP serving and
application drain with one five-second deadline measured from the shutdown signal. Incomplete
HTTP requests cannot postpone the game/session drain budget. Graceful final state, socket
closure and startup/I/O errors are preserved. On expiry, main returns and runtime teardown
releases remaining asynchronous I/O; this is an asynchronous budget, not a hard real-time bound.
The release also adopts the merged Napoleonic sheet and refreshed gameplay captures without
changing manifest slots, anchors, gameplay or texture budgets.

Application inputs match tested source `e758ad249a066854c35d200cf8e7ce866d8bda74`; the release
source adds documentation. Localhost:8085 serves accepted image
`sha256:cc8f5d0308b8e1d6b774f20dfcee20fdb49691c080e95ac95624d6c2bd3ce0af`.
Independent code, timing and artwork reviews are clear. Nineteen focused shutdown tests pass;
a deliberate nine-second mutant fails all three deadline cases. A real Linux container with
incomplete headers held until process exit terminates successfully in 5.127s with one deadline
warning. A graceful room/diagnostic probe exits in 0.115s, publishes `serverStopped` and closes
member, unseated and diagnostic sockets with code 1001. No frames or credentials are recorded.

Fresh source-bound Rust acceptance completes all 4,194,304 replay masks in debug, release and
official coverage in 433.085s, with zero retries. Each ordinary profile passes 930 core and
293 server tests plus two doctests; four existing performance tests remain ignored and the
heavy case runs separately across 32 complete partitions. Coverage is 17,278/18,480 lines
(93.50%) at the unchanged 90% floor. Rustfmt, Clippy, repository checks and the
[distinct Linux units](https://github.com/liveweird/grenadiers/actions/runs/40228900957) pass.
The first runner-fixture setup failed from an inherited target-directory override; the unchanged
fixture suite passed with its isolated environment before the complete runner passed.

The fresh web gate passes 6,791 tests / 88 files with 90.95/89.49/89.80/93.32% coverage.
JavaScript/CSS gzip sizes are 336,430/36,292 bytes within their budgets; contract, standalone
validator, lint and unused-code checks pass. Dependency inputs are unchanged from v0.3.57,
whose fresh Cargo-deny and both zero-finding npm audits are reused. A fresh pinned Trivy scan
of this exact image reports zero fixable HIGH/CRITICAL findings under the existing policy.

Exact-image Chromium acceptance passes nine Compose cases (eight default plus Oil Barrel)
and eight Kubernetes cases. Separate diagnostics under the enforced browser policy pass
14 artist, terrain, atlas and isolated renderer-lifecycle cases. These are representative
checks, not a rerun of every configured browser suite. Post-promotion runtime/security,
health/readiness, CSP/cache, exact HTML/JavaScript/atlas equality and one additional browser
smoke pass. Temporary acceptance resources are removed. Durable control is
`.local-checkpoints/runtime/compose-v0.3.58.yaml`; `rollback-v0.3.57.yaml` retains the previous
image. No migration is needed; restarts still end process-local matches. Keep external stop grace.

## v0.3.57 — 2026-10-25

[v0.3.57](https://github.com/liveweird/grenadiers/releases/tag/v0.3.57) gives shared Rust item/
effect DTOs, common item projections and bounded-number input neutral protocol ownership.
V7–V11 retain their public names and shared type identity. Reserved bits, activation subsets,
validation stages/errors, generation order, schema JSON and replay identities are unchanged.
Four independent regressions pin identity, retained schemas, serialization and numeric boundaries.
Application inputs match `a94aaddea8211e262c1d0acf3cf3103db797db05`; the source tag includes
release documentation. Localhost:8085 serves accepted image
`sha256:170e5d071feeabf6d62c55dcb1dce6b6191d7bcdbeccee511e1c9a1c8a72b9bf`.

Independent review is clear; moved bodies and mappings match baseline after path relocation.
Fresh source-bound Rust acceptance passes all 4,194,304 replay masks in debug, release and
reported coverage in 8m06s, without retries. Each ordinary profile passes 930 core and 287
server tests plus two doctests; four existing performance tests remain ignored, and the heavy
case runs separately across 32 complete partitions. Official line coverage is 17,248/18,445
(93.51%) at the unchanged 90% floor, with helper exclusions intact. Clippy/rustfmt, repository
checks and the [distinct Linux units](https://github.com/liveweird/grenadiers/actions/runs/40222285097) pass.

The fresh web gate passes 6,791 tests / 88 files with 90.95/89.49/89.80/93.32% coverage.
JavaScript/CSS gzip sizes remain 336,437/36,292 bytes within their budgets. All retained
contract/standalone drift checks pass. Fresh Cargo-deny, both zero-finding npm audits and the
pinned exact-image scan pass; the latter reports zero fixable HIGH/CRITICAL findings.

The exact image passes twenty native Chromium cases without retries: eight default cases
through Compose, eight through Kubernetes, and seeded Landmine, Heart, Cloak/reconnect/expiry
and Oil Barrel scenarios through Compose. Post-promotion checks pass runtime/image/security,
health/readiness, enforced CSP/cache headers, exact served HTML/JavaScript/atlas equality and
one additional native diagnostic/gameplay smoke. Claude's redraw is unchanged. Temporary
acceptance services and port-forwards are removed. Durable control is
`.local-checkpoints/runtime/compose-v0.3.57.yaml`; `rollback-v0.3.56.yaml` retains the prior image.
No migration is needed; restarts still end process-local matches.

A separate quiet probe of the unchanged shutdown path in v0.3.56 confirms a follow-up issue:
an incomplete HTTP request keeps the process running beyond seven seconds after SIGTERM,
before the application drain timer is reached. This release does not fix that ordering;
bounding total shutdown is the next isolated fix. Keep the configured external stop grace.

## v0.3.56 — 2026-10-25

[v0.3.56](https://github.com/liveweird/grenadiers/releases/tag/v0.3.56) shares the common
Playwright configuration across 24 simple gameplay wrappers. Public config names and commands,
artifact paths, worker/retry limits and base browser/environment settings are unchanged.
Audio keeps its 60-second timeout; the other 23 keep 90 seconds. Trace capture remains disabled.
Specialized configurations and the pickup/matches/reconnect chain remain separate.
Application inputs match `d7849292fed30d728bffcf0c106aff7d4a1cf6f8`; the source tag adds release
documentation. Localhost:8085 serves accepted image
`sha256:5f1e0627b21d18162c6b12e53516a934ea4d370a0e1a285b75bff2d551a6e603`.

Independent review, fresh types/lint/unused-code/scenario/repository checks and the wired
configuration regression pass. Complete before/after exports match in all 96 comparisons
(24 wrappers across four simulated environment/platform profiles), using pinned Playwright
`defineConfig` and device defaults, including undefined/symbol keys. This source evaluation
preserves Linux ANGLE and capture-profile settings; it is not native Linux browser execution.

The exact image passes nineteen Chromium cases without retries: eight default cases through
Compose, eight through Kubernetes, plus controls, natural headed audio and a seeded Landmine
scenario through Compose. The pinned image scan reports zero fixable HIGH/CRITICAL findings.
Post-promotion checks pass image/runtime security, health/readiness, CSP/cache headers, exact
served HTML/JavaScript/atlas bytes and one additional native diagnostic/gameplay smoke.
Claude's redraw is unchanged. Temporary acceptance services are removed.

Production Rust, API, frontend, asset and deployment sources are unchanged; Cargo changes only
local package versions. Reuse ordinary Rust/Linux results from v0.3.54, frontend/dependency/
renderer evidence from v0.3.53 and exhaustive replay/coverage measured at `055d1d2`
(all 4,194,304 masks, 93.15% line coverage at the 90% floor). These results are not claimed as
freshly rerun for configuration reuse. The new production image is built and accepted separately.

Durable control is `.local-checkpoints/runtime/compose-v0.3.56.yaml`; `rollback-v0.3.55.yaml`
retains the previous accepted image. No migration is needed; restarts end process-local matches.
The testing index/archive cleanup is included; its historical labels do not impose current gates.

## v0.3.55 — 2026-10-25

[v0.3.55](https://github.com/liveweird/grenadiers/releases/tag/v0.3.55) shares native responsive
browser-context setup across 26 gameplay scenarios. Two independent contexts still start
concurrently and return in desktop/mobile order. Viewports, mobile reduced motion, pickup's
390px override, privacy observations, assertions and caller-owned cleanup remain unchanged.
Application inputs match `8b7bacb82de085988e1592a280c0119ba3a41bfa`; the source tag includes
release documentation. Localhost:8085 serves accepted image
`sha256:a053abd96387ebe50f85b68aeecffcaa48160ccacb70a2f26f7808c1d7cee6d2`.

Independent review and fresh E2E types, lint, unused-code, repository and scenario checks pass.
The scenario gate includes the new exact-options, concurrency, reverse-resolution ordering and
native-identity regression. All 46 spec title inventories are unchanged; every migrated spec
is byte-identical outside its new import and equivalent setup block. Seventy-four mapped
scenarios remain registered; this static count is not a claim that all ran natively.

The exact image passes twenty Chromium cases without retries: eight default cases through
Compose, eight through Kubernetes, and four seeded Compose cases covering Landmine, 390px
pickups, recipient-private Cloak/reconnect/expiry and Invisible Bombs' live pixel/privacy window.
The pinned image scan reports zero fixable HIGH/CRITICAL findings. Post-promotion checks pass
health/readiness, runtime security, CSP/cache headers, exact served HTML/JavaScript/atlas bytes
and one fresh real-browser diagnostic/gameplay smoke. Claude's graphics are preserved.

Production Rust, API, frontend and asset sources are unchanged from v0.3.54; Cargo changes only
local package versions. Reuse v0.3.54 ordinary Rust/Linux results and v0.3.53 frontend/security/
renderer evidence. Exhaustive replay/coverage remains attributed to measured `055d1d2`
(all 4,194,304 masks, 93.15% line coverage at the 90% floor); none is claimed as freshly rerun
for test setup reuse. The production image is rebuilt and accepted independently.

Temporary acceptance services are removed. Durable control is
`.local-checkpoints/runtime/compose-v0.3.55.yaml`, with `rollback-v0.3.54.yaml` retaining the
previous accepted image. No migration is needed; restarting still ends process-local matches.
Configuration factories and broader fixture sharing remain separate work.

## v0.3.54 — 2026-10-25

[v0.3.54](https://github.com/liveweird/grenadiers/releases/tag/v0.3.54) extends the source-size
guard to every current and future item test tree and aggregates simulation test declarations.
All 926 core test names and all fifteen production module declarations retain their identity.
Application inputs match `c72da79b41b8b8ca83b0396b9cd9f18ab882f77c`; the source tag includes
release documentation. Localhost:8085 serves accepted image
`sha256:fd3d8bc815b6169208640b33df4690cb75b7ba98dbcd0d861d087f268760a829`.

Independent review is clear. The repository gate passes eight new filesystem fixtures plus
its existing workflow/dependency checks. Fresh ordinary debug and release runs each pass 926
core and 287 server tests plus two doctests; four existing performance tests remain ignored
and the exhaustive replay is excluded from these ordinary runs. Clippy, rustfmt and the
[distinct Linux unit job](https://github.com/liveweird/grenadiers/actions/runs/40218140208) pass.
The declaration-only change reuses exhaustive debug/release/coverage acceptance measured at
`055d1d2` (all 4,194,304 masks, 93.15% line coverage at the 90% floor). Unchanged frontend,
API, assets and server logic reuse v0.3.53 web, security and renderer evidence; these are not
claimed as freshly rerun v0.3.54 suites.

The exact new image passes eight Chromium cases through Compose and eight through Kubernetes,
with no retries. The pinned image scan reports zero fixable HIGH/CRITICAL findings. Promotion
checks pass health/readiness, image/security identity, CSP/cache headers, exact served
HTML/JavaScript/atlas equality and one fresh real-browser diagnostic/gameplay smoke. The
frontend bytes, including Claude's redraw, match v0.3.53. Temporary acceptance services are
removed; `.local-checkpoints/runtime/compose-v0.3.54.yaml` controls the live image and
`rollback-v0.3.53.yaml` retains the previous image. Matches remain process-local; no migration
is needed.

## v0.3.53 — 2026-10-25

[v0.3.53](https://github.com/liveweird/grenadiers/releases/tag/v0.3.53) adds bounded peer
admission, strict opt-in immediate-proxy identity, outstanding-session quotas and readable,
credential-free denial summaries, alongside the merged arena redraw. Application inputs match
`e1e10b0d889aa110c268bc17167b694423f6c8f2`; the source tag includes release documentation.
Localhost:8085 serves accepted image
`sha256:6035b215bd8ab428a749b9effa63261cc99b2bd4eee3d8bc69cb6c0dfe83ea7f`.

Full source-bound Rust acceptance at `055d1d2` passes every 4,194,304-mask case in debug,
release and official coverage at the 90% floor (7m45s, no retries). Measured application line
coverage is 17,197/18,461 (93.15%). A subsequent logging-target-only correction makes denial
summaries visible under the documented filter: final-source ordinary debug/release each pass
926 core and 287 server tests plus two doctests; clippy and rustfmt pass. The unchanged heavy
replay and coverage results remain attributed to their measured source, rather than claimed
as rerun after that literal change. Distinct Linux debug/release units pass at final source.

After artist PR #123 merges, Rust/Cargo/API inputs remain unchanged and the packaged server
binary is byte-identical to accepted `79a6527` (SHA-256 `13837b25c859c22a7d358c500e86cb304c94732c048823acd11385ae6438b97d`).
The affected full web gate passes 6,791 tests / 88 files at `e1e10b0`, with
90.95/89.49/89.80/93.32% coverage and unchanged floors. Compressed JavaScript/CSS are
336,437/36,292 bytes. Fresh Cargo-deny, both zero-finding npm audits, strict changed Kubernetes
checks and the final image scan pass; the image has zero fixable HIGH/CRITICAL findings under
the existing policy. Independent admission, log-filter and graphics integration reviews are clear.

The final image passes 26 Chromium cases without retries: twelve gameplay cases through
Compose (default eight, controls, audio, two reconnect), six HTTP/WS + HTTPS/WSS CSP cases and
eight through Kubernetes. Three relay/config regressions and fourteen separate enforced-policy renderer/artist cases pass,
including actual exports and an isolated active lifecycle cell. Separate real container TCP
checks prove untrusted forwarding is ignored, trusted malformed forwarding returns 400, sixteen
issued sessions exhaust only their minting peer with 429, and another peer remains eligible.
Actual default-filter summaries are visible and exclude the sentinel request value; unchanged server bytes preserve
that proof across the frontend-only merge.

Promotion health/readiness, exact runtime/image/security identity, real CSP/cache headers,
served HTML/JavaScript/atlas and a fresh browser diagnostic/gameplay flow pass. The served redraw
matches canonical SHA-256 `b057bafe7b32b76dd187fa44bf4bd6ebbb686b1aa0e8bbf8c5f633aea7ac7a6e`. Proxy trust is
empty for the direct local deployment. Temporary services, keys, worktree and branch are removed.
Durable control is `.local-checkpoints/runtime/compose-v0.3.53.yaml`; v0.3.52 remains for rollback.
Reload browser tabs; matches and quotas remain process-local. No database migration is needed.

These quotas are engineering defaults, not durable identity or a public deployment design.
Actual proxy addresses, overwrite behavior, restricted backend access, TLS and ingress limits
remain operator requirements. Claude's redraw is included; its manifest/frame geometry is unchanged,
and parity explicitly uses the packed procedural baseline while lifecycle tests load shipped art.

## v0.3.52 — 2026-10-25

[v0.3.52](https://github.com/liveweird/grenadiers/releases/tag/v0.3.52) enforces a compatible
browser content policy using static Pixi implementations and precompiled validators.
Application inputs match `578f581be1593b56ab589c6a8da2dce8a8e4fc8f`; the source tag includes
release documentation. Localhost:8085 serves accepted image
`sha256:9b5918458c30fd8dc8e877c8430607f09dd773abdec52f407bc139e5b58ddb85`.

Full source-bound Rust acceptance passes all 4,194,304 masks in debug, release and official
coverage at the 90% floor, with no retries. Application line coverage is 16,394/17,634 (92.97%).
The parallel gate phase completes in 7m23s while the web gate and image build also run. Web
passes 6,790 tests / 88 files with 90.95/89.49/89.78/93.32% coverage and unchanged floors;
compressed JavaScript/CSS are 336,413/36,292 bytes, within budgets. E2E static checks, three wired
relay/config regressions, the pinned image scan and the distinct Linux Rust unit job pass.
The image has zero fixable HIGH/CRITICAL findings under the existing scanner policy.

Before server delivery, enforced policy trials pass fourteen renderer/artist cases and controls,
audio and both reconnect cases with zero observed violations. Final acceptance uses the actual
server image without relay policy injection: eight native cases through Docker Compose, eight
through Kubernetes and six HTTP/WS + HTTPS/WSS CSP cases pass, with no retries. Real page scripts
prove execution/connection/worker blocking; the frame test isolates CSP from XFO and includes
an attachment control. An earlier relay reset crash and no-test selector are retained as failed
attempts, not passes. Independent review is clear.

Promotion health/readiness/index and a fresh native browser diagnostic/gameplay flow pass.
Served HTML/JavaScript/atlas bytes and runtime security identity match the accepted artifact;
CSP is enforced, including on API responses. Temporary acceptance services are removed.
Durable control is `.local-checkpoints/runtime/compose-v0.3.52.yaml`; v0.3.51 is retained for
rollback. Reload existing tabs; matches remain process-local. No migration is needed.

The style policy explicitly permits Mantine inline styles; scripts do not allow inline
execution or string compilation. Browser acceptance covers Chromium, not an untested wider
matrix. Peer-keyed hosting admission and the separate artist redraw remain future releases.

## v0.3.51 — 2026-10-25

[v0.3.51](https://github.com/liveweird/grenadiers/releases/tag/v0.3.51) precompiles the live
browser validators, preserving schemas, complete errors and semantic/privacy checks.
Application inputs match `a7ac65b36592ad8871a1a78f64f4e9adcc24eb36`; the source tag includes
release documentation. Localhost:8085 serves the accepted image
`sha256:cb7be95e9b5c6c291d8c828579b3de5facff9efb466d5a61e4dcdcadd2c7c76f`.

The full web gate passes 6,789 tests / 88 files at `31219c0`, with coverage
90.95/89.49/89.78/93.32% (statements/branches/functions/lines). Later portability corrections
change generated comments only; 13 focused tests, lint, Knip, drift, TypeScript and fresh
production builds pass on the final generator. Exact artifacts match across checkout depths,
invocation directories and pinned Linux. Compressed JavaScript falls from 357,324 to 333,442
bytes; CSS remains 36,292 bytes, within unchanged budgets. Independent review is clear.

Actual Chromium development and production flows validate live diagnostic welcome/pong and
gameplay admission. Sixteen native cases pass without retries: the default eight each in
Docker and Kubernetes on the same image. Kubernetes retains base security, probes and resource
limits. Strict schema checks and the pinned image scan pass, with zero fixable HIGH/CRITICAL
findings under the existing scanner policy. Isolated acceptance services are removed.

Rust source, wire contracts and external dependencies are unchanged from v0.3.50. Reuse its
full exhaustive/coverage acceptance; Linux debug/release units additionally pass at `b366958`,
whose Rust inputs equal the final candidate. Do not treat these reused results as a new full
Rust run. Docker's clean dependency install reports zero npm vulnerabilities.

Promotion health/readiness/index are 200. Served HTML/JavaScript/atlas match the image; the
atlas still matches canonical source. Runtime hardening remains intact. Durable deployment
control is `.local-checkpoints/runtime/compose-v0.3.51.yaml`; v0.3.50 is retained for rollback.
Reload browser tabs after upgrading; matches remain process-local. No database migration is
needed. CSP enforcement and the separate artist redraw remain pending.

Runtime attribution correction recorded with v0.3.52: the eight Docker cases used direct
`docker run`; the separately verified localhost promotion used Docker Compose. The original
source tag remains unchanged.

## v0.3.50 — 2026-10-25

[v0.3.50](https://github.com/liveweird/grenadiers/releases/tag/v0.3.50) hardens transport,
room recovery, browser responses and contributor checks. Application inputs match tested source
`9122e330379f4ac1bb3e0edd236dcdc5538655f0`; the source tag identifies the complete release.
Localhost:8085 serves the exact accepted image
`sha256:76980168a517474e680d8e346b6b8c38240a1b534eb403ad919b347168d0f5c6`.

Full Rust acceptance covers all 4,194,304 masks in debug, release and official coverage with no
retries (6m40s). Application line coverage is 92.97%; that fresh 80%-gated measurement supports
raising the Rust floor to 90%, verified by reporter contract/real-LLVM tests. The patched web gate
passes 6,780 tests in 86 files at the raised 90% line / 88% other floors. API/E2E static checks,
Cargo-deny, zero-finding full/production npm audits and the pinned image scan pass; the image has
zero fixable HIGH/CRITICAL findings under the existing scanner policy.

Eighteen native cases pass on this image: sixteen Compose cases covering the default suite,
controls, audio, match progression, reconnect/deadline, Cloak, Stopwatch and Oil; two Kubernetes
reconnect cases retain the base pod security/probes/resources. Failed sandbox launches, the
socket timing regression and the stale Equipment-error assertion were corrected and are not
carried as passes. Fresh accepted suites use no retries.

Promotion health/readiness/index are 200; served HTML/JavaScript/atlas bytes match the image,
and atlas pixels match canonical source. UID65532, read-only filesystem, dropped capabilities
and no new privileges remain. v0.3.49 is retained for rollback. Runtime control files now live
in `.local-checkpoints/runtime/`, rather than `/tmp`. Reload existing tabs; active matches and
capabilities remain process-local. No database migration is required.

The artist redraw remains a separate pending change. Further CSP, hosting and structural work
is tracked in the [quality-review response](../quality-review.md).

## v0.3.49 published prerelease — 2026-10-25

[v0.3.49](https://github.com/liveweird/grenadiers/releases/tag/v0.3.49) is published from source
`4157d534553330b457871554d84e973823068798`, tree `dd6a844d841e76e254ee09b339a4e4c6577f982f`,
with remotely verified annotated tag object `1a8f141adbf6c18e372a1b6dd344475727664233`.
Localhost:8085 serves exact accepted image
`sha256:10aa8554f8f22f968a6bd1852a4c0d6fe43e63b365eafc8220e7fbd826dc4d21`.

Promotion exits zero; health/readiness/index return 200. Served HTML, JavaScript and the hashed
atlas PNG match container bytes; the PNG also matches canonical source SHA256
`f2392294ba67207cdaf264ec3343cf096de0281dc281aa4c8c3339ff312d407f`. UID65532, read-only
filesystem, dropped capabilities and no new privileges are retained. v0.3.48 remains the rollback
image. An initial local helper path typo stopped before any service change; the corrected helper
completed promotion and all post-deployment checks. Application inputs match accepted source
`ee664e5`; publication documentation does not require rebuilding the accepted image.

The artist handoff/export/preview and gameplay atlas integration are now complete. New artist
redraws remain separate work. The documented completed-icon pulse compositing is intentional.

## Historical v0.3.44 Kick native-acceptance checkpoint — 2026-10-24

Kick candidate source `cb70cba891ed972380f30f52133622ce36fd9ee8`, tree
`5be27219ba749d2811396d6f84af7d31f528a692`, passes fresh source-bound Rust, web, E2E and security
gates. Every Rust profile passes 763 core and 210 server tests with four documented ignores and
enumerates all 524,288 settings masks; debug and release each pass two doctests. Rust line coverage
is 15,233/16,429 (92.720190%). The web gate passes 1,059 tests across 66 files with
95.26/90.9/96/97.67% coverage and 57 static scenarios. Configured security retains three affected
moderate packages represented by six GHSA advisories, with no high or critical findings; E2E audit
reports zero vulnerabilities. Gate receipt
`903736dda1001d60f83204fa10f58940796c87716a5d9eea151b58e62fd97153` binds actual-zero roots

passes all 56 Compose plus 56 Kubernetes cases with zero retries or carried results. Root `97948`
finishes with consumed actual exit zero; the matrix retains 54 reports, 126 PNGs, 44 runtime
records, 22 distinct Kubernetes identities, 21 fixtures and 42 seed records. Each target passes 22
latency cases and retains 80 game observations under the unchanged 250 ms budget. The earlier
failed attempt's 55 cases are not carried.

unchanged Docker inputs, a new Rust compilation, or new native execution. Eighteen of 22 requested
items are published at this checkpoint. Kick is the v0.3.44 native-accepted candidate; hosted CI
and publication follow.

## Historical v0.3.43 Wall Pass native checkpoint — 2026-10-24 01:00 UTC

Wall Pass is the eighteenth requested item and is native verified at source
`11d0dc7e39e8e2cafcf70c1548be339f52c740ab`, tree
`655c7d8a80b4dd3fdd3b232534c2cbaa45b054cc`, on exact image
`sha256:577abb32958e45912f35a7f6ae68dd624deb6515d2b4d55519942c44436a2a01`.
Fresh gates pass 711 core and 209 server tests with four historical ignores in each Rust profile,
797 web tests across 64 files, 56 scenarios and all 262,144 masks in debug, release and coverage.
Rust line coverage is 92.358954%; web statement/branch/function/line coverage is
95.24/90.88/96/97.66%. The configured security commands pass; the web inventory retains two
moderate development advisories and no high or critical advisories.

Native root `45615` completes with consumed exit zero: all 55 Compose plus 55 Kubernetes cases,
52 reports, 122 PNGs, 42 runtime records, 21 Kubernetes identities, 20 fixtures, 40 seed records
and 80 latency observations below 250 ms pass with zero retries or carried results. Independent
audit `25e48638872f7b61fd64c28af30abf5e44910cf29e3e8356246236991819380e` and result review
`c8652f4e67852002db9e49e2766481e6c58b071d3e93bbb7866bfd6c5194848d` are clear. Binding review
`7c6eda746a703f599ced928798750f05478b78dbf5fc387d03fbe5adac551d46` is clear. Sealer root
`96118` completes with consumed exit zero; final manifest
`3ac5e05ccee94c7716376ca9383c75acc924b772447499c6a0dbd857f68ec15c` authenticates 2,665
payloads, 2,666 files and 284 directories. Seal
`31fe5eef2900a0229d002e45b5a310888f3915829db0aaf23bc3535a8eea5e2c` is durable; independent
post-seal review `5d253559ba95a9d30fc83f16fd0786a6d283356d892f26abed3611771588d33f`
is clear.

The source includes the reviewed Zod 4.6.6 lockfile correction and parallel independent English
match-result inspections without changing the 43 assertions, three screenshots, fixtures or
budgets. The descendant release candidate adds CI-only procfs short-read and external-target
coverage-parent fixes in commit `dee44b5ca81d2556d775a54e47948da77b9dbaa3`. Its production and
Docker build inputs remain byte-identical to the sealed native source. Those fixes improve
diagnostics and gate setup without claiming that a particular Chrome I/O cause was fixed.

Latest corrected candidate `5dbcd58e920f852a8036c4bf741e26517793b072` pins Happy DOM 21.0.4 to
resolve GHSA-834v-8h66-3h79. Fresh local verification passes the full 797-test, 64-file web gate
with unchanged 95.24/90.88/96/97.66% coverage and the complete configured security gate: cargo
deny plus both npm audits exit zero, with three moderate development advisories
(`@vitest/mocker`, `vitest` and `fast-uri`) and zero high or critical findings. Receipt
`0a8c605c65bdceff9d04d74752aaafc3ee5e9ee2378e60805a7fecb8cc216ce0` binds the web check, and
`e0c7363348d4f4092bc0afd3037068e183b78bc99c0969a6a2ef7b6451fdceb6` binds the full security
result. The two web manifests are the only changed Docker inputs: 554 of 556 entries remain equal.
The complete host distribution still matches the accepted image byte-for-byte across 17 entries
(15 files and two directories), using retained server binary
`26bccf1696b75b33b741b43305429df92cd09870d02d1080b725e05665e3966d`; a fresh scan of that exact
image passes current policy. Equivalence receipt
`81bd78943fa8e80bc839b06bcd68c7bb26872f4cf600c2fcc80e2269c7c94209` and independent review
`42bbbcb68e8a306d9ed611513e186189ab3430f17bf545191edace5bdb6e3b75` are clear. This is retained
artifact equality, not unchanged build inputs, a new Rust compilation, or Docker-build
reproducibility; the 110 native cases remain attributed to source `11d0dc7` and accepted image
`577abb3`.

At this checkpoint, the first PR #104 head `98dffe5` failed security in push run `40050321682` and PR run
`40050338206`; other jobs were still finishing at that checkpoint. Corrected head `5dbcd58` has
not yet been pushed. Those then-pending steps were later completed by the published delivery above.

This section is the dated native checkpoint, not the current release status. The published record
above supersedes its pending statements. Kick, Punch, Bracelet and Oil Barrel remain before
ART-ATLAS.

## v0.3.41 published prerelease — 2026-10-23

Commit `f5c4adf66f8af9a5ef66b48f9230d17aea14f1d5`, tree
`a274fb2fe828f3a18a624614f1addf5bf5df4d99`, is published as prerelease tag `v0.3.41`.
Post-merge run `39879618476` and distinct tag run `39881306987` each pass all nine jobs,
53 browser cases and 65,536 settings masks. The published source retains the accepted application,
E2E and native inputs, while the CI-only browser readiness and observer changes retain their own
reviewed identity. The sealed native image
`sha256:d063462c3130e3c8653734da72e8dfd6785b0c036e9579d9046cee884ccd9f82` is promoted
locally with consumed exit zero. At that release checkpoint, sixteen of 22 requested item types
were published; the v0.3.42 delivery record above documents Teleporter's later publication.

## v0.3.41 browser file readiness checkpoint — 2026-10-23

The observability-only PR 92 was closed after its required PR workflow failed
while starting Chromium; its parallel successful push run supplies no acceptance
for a later source. A bounded pre-read of the installed browser files targets the
observed kernel page waits. Additional fault, I/O and pressure counters preserve
useful evidence without asserting an exact file or storage cause.

At this historical checkpoint v0.3.41 was unpublished and localhost:8085 served v0.3.40.
The application, E2E and native inputs retain H's accepted bytes; the native
106-case execution remains labeled H. Require independently reviewed input
identity and fresh push, PR, post-merge and tag checks for the meaningful CI
revision before promoting H's sealed image. See the [verification record](verification.md).

## v0.3.41 observability checkpoint — 2026-10-23

Invisible Bombs was merged in PR 91, but post-merge workflow `39870771097` failed
while starting the headed visibility browser. At that recovery checkpoint, v0.3.41
was unpublished and the local deployment served v0.3.40. The CI-only observer revision gathers bounded
process and Xvfb diagnostics without changing gameplay or test budgets; a passing
instrumented run does not establish the cause of the intermittent failure.

The recovery rolled forward from merged commit `2fbc782` while keeping version 0.3.41.
Native proofs retain their original source identity under independently reviewed input equality.
Failed hosted runs contribute zero accepted cases. See the
[historical investigation](verification.md#v0341-post-merge-startup-investigation--2026-10-23).
