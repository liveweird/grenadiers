# Releases

Planned release scope and work status live in the [backlog](../BACKLOG.md).
The [implementation plan](game/implementation-plan.md) defines the release checklist and future tracks.
A completed milestone is verification evidence; a release exists only after its tested commit
is tagged and its artifacts are published intentionally.

## Release verification policy

For this single-maintainer project, local checks are as authoritative as equivalent remote
checks. Ship the tested source and reuse its verified artifacts. Remote checks are required only
when they add coverage not exercised locally; a tag pointing at an already verified commit does
not require another complete suite.

Record the version, tested commit, applicable checks and outcomes, runtime environment and image
digest in the release notes. Confirm the tag targets the intended commit and check health,
readiness and the served artifact after deployment. Repeat affected checks when inputs change;
do not require separate full push, PR, master and tag runs or elaborate new proof packages for
each feature. Historical release records retain their original evidence and requirements.

## Version ownership

Use Git tags `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` for the combined server/web product. Cargo workspace package
versions track the next product candidate; keep the local
`grenadiers-core` dependency version aligned when changing them. Private npm package versions
remain `0.0.0`: they are build inputs and are not separately published or product release IDs.
The WebSocket `protocolVersion` is an independent compatibility contract, not a release number.

Each shipped feature PR bumps the product version and records its scope in `CHANGELOG.md`.
Use patch releases for bounded engineering increments; historical milestone labels are preserved
in the [plan archive](history/implementation-plan.md). Keep PRs focused on one behavior and its tests. Merge passing,
independently reviewed candidates, then publish the corresponding prerelease tag.
The repository gate checks that both local Cargo packages and their dependency agree.

### Release preparation helper

Stage the candidate notes under `CHANGELOG.md`'s Unreleased heading. Set `NEXT_VERSION` to the
chosen newer product version and `RELEASE_DATE` to its `YYYY-MM-DD` date, then preview:

```sh
node scripts/prepare-release.mjs --version "$NEXT_VERSION" --date "$RELEASE_DATE"
```

The default is a dry run. Add `--write` only after reviewing the plan; it updates the Cargo
workspace and local-package lock versions, then moves the Unreleased notes into the requested
dated release while retaining an empty Unreleased section. It does not run checks or perform
Git, tag, publish, or network operations. Run the applicable release checks separately.

## Candidate checklist

1. Update package metadata, lockfiles, contracts, and affected documentation intentionally.
2. Run the complete [release checklist](game/implementation-plan.md#release-checklist), including
   coverage, dependency audits, the image scan, real browser scenarios, and Compose/Kubernetes
   runtime checks. Record commands, results, image identity, and limitations in
   [verification.md](verification.md).
3. Obtain independent review of substantive changes. Commit a focused candidate and rerun
   affected checks if the reviewed source changes.
4. When publishing is authorized, tag that tested commit and promote the exact tested image;
   avoid rebuilding an unverified replacement under the release tag. Include supported rules,
   preview limits, and upgrade notes in the release notes.

## Current prerelease distribution

Current releases publish source tags and GitHub prerelease notes. Accepted image IDs in the
verification record identify locally tested artifacts; no production registry or hosted service
has been configured. A source prerelease does not claim a production deployment.

Evidence may name a clean candidate commit from before rebase or squash. Before merging,
compare its Docker build inputs with the final PR head, require the applicable local-first checks to pass,
and verify that the merged tree equals that head. Use the corresponding release tag for the
published source. Retain the accepted image when exact artifact reuse is required; a later
rebuild can receive different operating-system security updates and needs its own acceptance.

## Upgrade and rollback

The initial deployment uses one replica and `Recreate`. In-memory matches cannot survive
restart or rollback. Plan upgrades around active matches; a graceful stop publishes the final
interrupted state but cannot preserve process-local matches or credentials.
Keep the previous immutable image reference for rollback; database migration compatibility
must be designed when durable application data is introduced.

### Runtime operating-system refresh

Perform a controlled runtime refresh weekly and when a relevant Debian or runtime advisory
requires it. Keep the reviewed base digest and rebuild only the runtime stage without its cached
layer, following Buildx's
[`--no-cache-filter` contract](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/buildx/build/#no-cache-filter):

```sh
docker buildx build --no-cache-filter runtime --load --tag grenadiers:candidate-os-refresh .
```

Record the resulting exact image ID, scan that ID with the pinned release vulnerability scanner,
and run the applicable runtime acceptance against that same ID. Promote only the accepted ID and
retain the previous immutable image reference for rollback. The runtime stage intentionally runs
rolling Debian package updates, so a later build may resolve newer packages and is not expected to
be byte-identical; treat it as a new candidate with new evidence rather than reusing acceptance.

## v0.3.83 — 2026-10-27

[v0.3.83](https://github.com/liveweird/grenadiers/releases/tag/v0.3.83) adds complete bounded
[timed CPU routes](game/cpu-contracts.md#committed-timed-routes): several moves and waits share
one checked program across exact admission-time lanes. The owner executes it without another
worker result. Each move includes three stopped updates; missing post-Stop observations,
rejected commands or missed deadlines invalidate the schedule. Expected bomb removals, blasts,
flame expiry and known Oil ignition are distinguished from new hazards.

The updated opponent is UtilityV3. V1/V2 recorded inputs remain readable and the v12 wire shape,
rules 5, generator 2 and all 22 default items stay unchanged. Conditional routes retain explicit
motion assumptions and never authorize planting. Existing clear-board movement and restricted
CPU1 planting remain separate; broader ordinary planting is next in the
[backlog](../BACKLOG.md#single-player). New enemy actions and unknown facts can invalidate a plan.
The injected-State driver escape and generation-journal replay are tested separately; this
release does not claim a combined oracle.

Final tested source is `58798266517582bf96b263fbd2655f9c405d54f9`. Independent reviews are clear
after fixing concrete Oil, search dominance, clock, Stop-confirmation and admission issues.
A pre-publication correction also prevents certificates from relying on temporary collision:
neutral motion clips only permanent terrain/boundaries, while sweeps through soft blocks or
unlit Oil are rejected. Actual-State regressions cover WallPass and mid-pulse destruction/
ignition. The earlier passing source is retained as superseded evidence; acceptance below
belongs to the corrected source.

Full local Rust acceptance passes in 500.817s with all 4,194,304 masks in each of debug,
release and official coverage, 32 partitions/four workers, zero retries and 37 raw profiles.
Coverage is 23,552/25,629 lines (91.90%). The distinct
[Linux debug/release run](https://github.com/liveweird/grenadiers/actions/runs/40422219725) passes.
Formatting, Clippy, repository/source-size checks and dependency audits pass; both npm audits
have zero vulnerabilities. Unchanged web/API/artwork/E2E/deployment/tooling inputs reuse their
accepted full web (6,874 tests/97 files), coverage and static evidence; rebuilt served assets
remain byte-identical to v0.3.82.

Exact accepted image is
`sha256:b7f7475fd87d0a47739dc7a7e6264a4342ac0953ff2b6c1bcd198bbb8b3ea580`.
Pinned Trivy 0.74.0 reports zero fixable HIGH/CRITICAL findings. Compose passes ten native browser
cases in 55.1s; Kubernetes passes ten in 55.6s. Actual Solo result/rematch/reconnect/leave,
two-human play, Polish 320px accessibility, strict lobby/create, security/resources/probes and
served-asset checks pass. Temporary projects/namespaces are removed. The exact image is promoted
to localhost:8085 with v0.3.82 retained for rollback; restarting ends in-memory matches.

Evidence remains under `target/quality-review/cpu2-v0383-*`; superseded evidence is explicitly
prefixed `cpu2-v0383-pre-motion-*`. Distribution is a source prerelease and local accepted image,
without a production registry or hosted-service claim.
