# Releases

Release labels and scope live in the [implementation plan](game/implementation-plan.md).
A completed milestone is verification evidence; a release exists only after its tested commit
is tagged and its artifacts are published intentionally.

## Release verification policy

For this single-maintainer project, local checks are as authoritative as equivalent remote
checks. Ship the tested source and reuse its verified artifacts. Remote checks are required only
when they add coverage not exercised locally; a tag pointing at an already verified commit does
not require another complete suite.

Record the version, tested commit, applicable checks and outcomes, runtime environment and image
digest in the release notes. Confirm the tag targets the intended commit and check health,
readiness and the served artifact after deployment. Repeat affected checks when inputs change;
do not require separate full push, PR, master and tag runs or elaborate new proof packages for
each feature. Historical release records retain their original evidence and requirements.

## Version ownership

Use Git tags `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` for the combined server/web product. Cargo workspace package
versions track the next product candidate; keep the local
`grenadiers-core` dependency version aligned when changing them. Private npm package versions
remain `0.0.0`: they are build inputs and are not separately published or product release IDs.
The WebSocket `protocolVersion` is an independent compatibility contract, not a release number.

Each shipped feature PR bumps the product version and records its scope in `CHANGELOG.md`.
Use patch releases within the current milestone for bounded engineering increments.
`0.2.0` is the first playable duel preview; `0.3.0` adds classic match progression. Subsequent
`0.3.x` increments stage reconnect support and activate it at `0.3.9`; `0.4.0` remains the resilient playtest milestone. Keep PRs focused on one behavior and its tests. Merge passing,
independently reviewed candidates, then publish the corresponding prerelease tag.
The repository gate checks that both local Cargo packages and their dependency agree.

## Candidate checklist

1. Update package metadata, lockfiles, contracts, and affected documentation intentionally.
2. Run the complete [release checklist](game/implementation-plan.md#release-checklist), including
   coverage, dependency audits, the image scan, real browser scenarios, and Compose/Kubernetes
   runtime checks. Record commands, results, image identity, and limitations in
   [verification.md](verification.md).
3. Obtain independent review of substantive changes. Commit a focused candidate and rerun
   affected checks if the reviewed source changes.
4. When publishing is authorized, tag that tested commit and promote the exact tested image;
   avoid rebuilding an unverified replacement under the release tag. Include supported rules,
   preview limits, and upgrade notes in the release notes.

## Current prerelease distribution

Current releases publish source tags and GitHub prerelease notes. Accepted image IDs in the
verification record identify locally tested artifacts; no production registry or hosted service
has been configured. A source prerelease does not claim a production deployment.

Evidence may name a clean candidate commit from before rebase or squash. Before merging,
compare its Docker build inputs with the final PR head, require every configured push/PR check to pass,
and verify that the merged tree equals that head. Use the corresponding release tag for the
published source. Retain the accepted image when exact artifact reuse is required; a later
rebuild can receive different operating-system security updates and needs its own acceptance.

## Upgrade and rollback

The initial deployment uses one replica and `Recreate`. In-memory matches cannot survive
restart or rollback. Plan upgrades around active matches; a graceful stop publishes the final
interrupted state but cannot preserve process-local matches or credentials.
Keep the previous immutable image reference for rollback; database migration compatibility
must be designed when durable application data is introduced.

## v0.3.49 published prerelease — 2026-10-25

[v0.3.49](https://github.com/liveweird/grenadiers/releases/tag/v0.3.49) is published from source
`4157d534553330b457871554d84e973823068798`, tree `dd6a844d841e76e254ee09b339a4e4c6577f982f`,
with remotely verified annotated tag object `1a8f141adbf6c18e372a1b6dd344475727664233`.
Localhost:8085 serves exact accepted image
`sha256:10aa8554f8f22f968a6bd1852a4c0d6fe43e63b365eafc8220e7fbd826dc4d21`.

Promotion exits zero; health/readiness/index return 200. Served HTML, JavaScript and the hashed
atlas PNG match container bytes; the PNG also matches canonical source SHA256
`f2392294ba67207cdaf264ec3343cf096de0281dc281aa4c8c3339ff312d407f`. UID65532, read-only
filesystem, dropped capabilities and no new privileges are retained. v0.3.48 remains the rollback
image. An initial local helper path typo stopped before any service change; the corrected helper
completed promotion and all post-deployment checks. Application inputs match accepted source
`ee664e5`; publication documentation does not require rebuilding the accepted image.

The artist handoff/export/preview and gameplay atlas integration are now complete. New artist
redraws remain separate work. The documented completed-icon pulse compositing is intentional.

See the [renderer guide](game/art-atlas.md) and [acceptance record](verification.md#v0349-gameplay-atlas-acceptance--2026-10-25).
