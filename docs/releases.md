# Releases

Planned release scope and work status live in the [backlog](../BACKLOG.md).
The [implementation plan](game/implementation-plan.md) defines the release checklist and future tracks.
A completed milestone is verification evidence; a release exists only after its tested commit
is tagged and its artifacts are published intentionally.

## Release verification policy

For this single-maintainer project, local checks are as authoritative as equivalent remote
checks. Ship the tested source and reuse its verified artifacts. Remote checks are required only
when they add coverage not exercised locally; a tag pointing at an already verified commit does
not require another complete suite.

Record the version, tested commit, applicable checks and outcomes, runtime environment and image
digest in the release notes. Confirm the tag targets the intended commit and check health,
readiness and the served artifact after deployment. Repeat affected checks when inputs change;
do not require separate full push, PR, master and tag runs or elaborate new proof packages for
each feature. Historical release records retain their original evidence and requirements.

## Version ownership

Use Git tags `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` for the combined server/web product. Cargo workspace package
versions track the next product candidate; keep the local
`grenadiers-core` dependency version aligned when changing them. Private npm package versions
remain `0.0.0`: they are build inputs and are not separately published or product release IDs.
The WebSocket `protocolVersion` is an independent compatibility contract, not a release number.

Each shipped feature PR bumps the product version and records its scope in `CHANGELOG.md`.
Use patch releases for bounded engineering increments; historical milestone labels are preserved
in the [plan archive](history/implementation-plan.md). Keep PRs focused on one behavior and its tests. Merge passing,
independently reviewed candidates, then publish the corresponding prerelease tag.
The repository gate checks that both local Cargo packages and their dependency agree.

### Release preparation helper

Stage the candidate notes under `CHANGELOG.md`'s Unreleased heading. Set `NEXT_VERSION` to the
chosen newer product version and `RELEASE_DATE` to its `YYYY-MM-DD` date, then preview:

```sh
node scripts/prepare-release.mjs --version "$NEXT_VERSION" --date "$RELEASE_DATE"
```

The default is a dry run. Add `--write` only after reviewing the plan; it updates the Cargo
workspace and local-package lock versions, then moves the Unreleased notes into the requested
dated release while retaining an empty Unreleased section. It does not run checks or perform
Git, tag, publish, or network operations. Run the applicable release checks separately.

## Candidate checklist

1. Update package metadata, lockfiles, contracts, and affected documentation intentionally.
2. Run the complete [release checklist](game/implementation-plan.md#release-checklist), including
   coverage, dependency audits, the image scan, real browser scenarios, and Compose/Kubernetes
   runtime checks. Record commands, results, image identity, and limitations in
   [verification.md](verification.md).
3. Obtain independent review of substantive changes. Commit a focused candidate and rerun
   affected checks if the reviewed source changes.
4. When publishing is authorized, tag that tested commit and promote the exact tested image;
   avoid rebuilding an unverified replacement under the release tag. Include supported rules,
   preview limits, and upgrade notes in the release notes.

## Current prerelease distribution

Current releases publish source tags and GitHub prerelease notes. Accepted image IDs in the
verification record identify locally tested artifacts; no production registry or hosted service
has been configured. A source prerelease does not claim a production deployment.

Evidence may name a clean candidate commit from before rebase or squash. Before merging,
compare its Docker build inputs with the final PR head, require the applicable local-first checks to pass,
and verify that the merged tree equals that head. Use the corresponding release tag for the
published source. Retain the accepted image when exact artifact reuse is required; a later
rebuild can receive different operating-system security updates and needs its own acceptance.

## Upgrade and rollback

The initial deployment uses one replica and `Recreate`. In-memory matches cannot survive
restart or rollback. Plan upgrades around active matches; a graceful stop publishes the final
interrupted state but cannot preserve process-local matches or credentials.
Keep the previous immutable image reference for rollback; database migration compatibility
must be designed when durable application data is introduced.

## v0.3.66 — 2026-10-26

[v0.3.66](https://github.com/liveweird/grenadiers/releases/tag/v0.3.66) derives reserved item
identities, bits, pickup declarations and total mappings from one private 22-item specification.
Generation order, activation subsets, replay values, public schemas and gameplay behavior remain
unchanged. The existing v0.3.65 web build is reused.

Independent review is clear. Fresh source-bound Rust acceptance at
`c244193ae048f3dea2864bd120511be60981bb09` completes every 4,194,304 mask in debug, release and
official coverage in 429.862s with zero retries. The ordinary profiles each pass 934 core / 307
server tests plus two doctests. Coverage is 17,615/18,793 lines (93.7317%) at the 90% floor.
Rustfmt, Clippy, repository checks and
[distinct Linux units](https://github.com/liveweird/grenadiers/actions/runs/40240422294) pass.
Full v0.3.65 web acceptance is reused: 6,812 tests / 91 files with
91.10/89.47/90.12/93.47% coverage.

Accepted image source is `c244193ae048f3dea2864bd120511be60981bb09`; its image is
`sha256:d4906dd81f0c86803e8d7a96bd890723ec180718d9cc015c286d7d94ebfc941d`.
Eight fresh native Compose cases and eight Kubernetes cases pass in 36.1s and 36.9s,
respectively, including exact-image, runtime-security, origin, readiness/probe/resource and
gameplay checks. Heart, Kick, Invisibility Cloak and Oil browser scenarios pass. The pinned image
scan reports zero fixable HIGH/CRITICAL findings.

Localhost:8085 serves the accepted image. Runtime security, health/readiness, CSP/cache and exact
served-artifact checks pass, plus one fresh native authentication case. An initial attempt found
missing E2E dependencies before any case ran; after installing the declared dependencies, the
fresh acceptance above passed without product retries. Release-documentation changes preserve
Docker and application inputs and skip duplicate CI. Control is
`.local-checkpoints/runtime/compose-v0.3.66.yaml`; `rollback-v0.3.65.yaml` retains the prior image.
Temporary acceptance resources are removed. There is no migration.
