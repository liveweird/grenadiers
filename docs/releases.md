# Releases

Planned release scope and work status live in the [backlog](../BACKLOG.md).
The [implementation plan](game/implementation-plan.md) defines the release checklist and future tracks.
A completed milestone is verification evidence; a release exists only after its tested commit
is tagged and its artifacts are published intentionally.

## Release verification policy

For this single-maintainer project, local checks are as authoritative as equivalent remote
checks. Ship the tested source and reuse its verified artifacts. Remote checks are required only
when they add coverage not exercised locally; a tag pointing at an already verified commit does
not require another complete suite.

Record the version, tested commit, applicable checks and outcomes, runtime environment and image
digest in the release notes. Confirm the tag targets the intended commit and check health,
readiness and the served artifact after deployment. Repeat affected checks when inputs change;
do not require separate full push, PR, master and tag runs or elaborate new proof packages for
each feature. Historical release records retain their original evidence and requirements.

## Version ownership

Use Git tags `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` for the combined server/web product. Cargo workspace package
versions track the next product candidate; keep the local
`grenadiers-core` dependency version aligned when changing them. Private npm package versions
remain `0.0.0`: they are build inputs and are not separately published or product release IDs.
The WebSocket `protocolVersion` is an independent compatibility contract, not a release number.

Each shipped feature PR bumps the product version and records its scope in `CHANGELOG.md`.
Use patch releases for bounded engineering increments; historical milestone labels are preserved
in the [plan archive](history/implementation-plan.md). Keep PRs focused on one behavior and its tests. Merge passing,
independently reviewed candidates, then publish the corresponding prerelease tag.
The repository gate checks that both local Cargo packages and their dependency agree.

### Release preparation helper

Stage the candidate notes under `CHANGELOG.md`'s Unreleased heading. Set `NEXT_VERSION` to the
chosen newer product version and `RELEASE_DATE` to its `YYYY-MM-DD` date, then preview:

```sh
node scripts/prepare-release.mjs --version "$NEXT_VERSION" --date "$RELEASE_DATE"
```

The default is a dry run. Add `--write` only after reviewing the plan; it updates the Cargo
workspace and local-package lock versions, then moves the Unreleased notes into the requested
dated release while retaining an empty Unreleased section. It does not run checks or perform
Git, tag, publish, or network operations. Run the applicable release checks separately.

## Candidate checklist

1. Update package metadata, lockfiles, contracts, and affected documentation intentionally.
2. Run the complete [release checklist](game/implementation-plan.md#release-checklist), including
   coverage, dependency audits, the image scan, real browser scenarios, and Compose/Kubernetes
   runtime checks. Record commands, results, image identity, and limitations in
   [verification.md](verification.md).
3. Obtain independent review of substantive changes. Commit a focused candidate and rerun
   affected checks if the reviewed source changes.
4. When publishing is authorized, tag that tested commit and promote the exact tested image;
   avoid rebuilding an unverified replacement under the release tag. Include supported rules,
   preview limits, and upgrade notes in the release notes.

## Current prerelease distribution

Current releases publish source tags and GitHub prerelease notes. Accepted image IDs in the
verification record identify locally tested artifacts; no production registry or hosted service
has been configured. A source prerelease does not claim a production deployment.

Evidence may name a clean candidate commit from before rebase or squash. Before merging,
compare its Docker build inputs with the final PR head, require the applicable local-first checks to pass,
and verify that the merged tree equals that head. Use the corresponding release tag for the
published source. Retain the accepted image when exact artifact reuse is required; a later
rebuild can receive different operating-system security updates and needs its own acceptance.

## Upgrade and rollback

The initial deployment uses one replica and `Recreate`. In-memory matches cannot survive
restart or rollback. Plan upgrades around active matches; a graceful stop publishes the final
interrupted state but cannot preserve process-local matches or credentials.
Keep the previous immutable image reference for rollback; database migration compatibility
must be designed when durable application data is introduced.

## v0.3.73 — 2026-10-26

[v0.3.73](https://github.com/liveweird/grenadiers/releases/tag/v0.3.73) adds competing-resume
and cancellation regressions, including real socket takeover fencing. Two valid queued resumes
may both commit in order; the last binding is authoritative. Canceled admissions do not commit.
Production ownership and wire behavior remain unchanged.

The parallel Rust runner now fails early when Cargo rejects a restored coverage cache and
isolates official reporting to every instrumented workspace executable selected from one Cargo
JSON stream. Binary/profile identities, the 90% floor, exclusions and every mask assertion remain.
Independent review covers stale-object reproduction, complete lib/main selection, artifact mutation,
preexisting-target preservation, owned cleanup and symlink rejection. A scratch execution record
is written before reporting. This closes the [earlier report-contamination failure](history/coverage-cache-recovery.md).

Full source-bound acceptance at `822991f6e22817d525d4a300ebb24e21f48bac49` passes in 452.372s:
951 core / 316 ordinary server tests and two doctests per profile, all 4,194,304 masks in debug,
release and official coverage, zero retries. Coverage is 17,864/19,553 lines (91.3619%).
[Integrated Linux debug/release units](https://github.com/liveweird/grenadiers/actions/runs/40373348609)
pass with identical competing-resume tests. Unchanged web/dependency acceptance reuses v0.3.72.

Accepted image source is `806c13d0f25ac7327df49237f08fddd50ea94259`, whose Docker inputs equal
those of the tested source; runner-only changes are outside the image. Accepted image is
`sha256:06d7c75d4148ee2ff9897d984407450a465f4b34ac4ca404ef9473a9ec616121`.
Trivy 0.74.0 reports zero fixable HIGH/CRITICAL findings. Eight Compose and eight Kubernetes
cases each pass in 36.6s, including exact-image/security/probe/resource checks; temporary resources
are removed. Localhost:8085 has verified health/readiness, CSP/cache and unchanged served web bytes.
Control is `.local-checkpoints/runtime/compose-v0.3.73.yaml`; `rollback-v0.3.72.yaml` retains the
prior image. No gameplay, protocol, artwork or migration change; distribution remains source prereleases.
