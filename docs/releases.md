# Releases

Planned release scope and work status live in the [backlog](../BACKLOG.md).
The [implementation plan](game/implementation-plan.md) defines the release checklist and future tracks.
A completed milestone is verification evidence; a release exists only after its tested commit
is tagged and its artifacts are published intentionally.

## Release verification policy

For this single-maintainer project, local checks are as authoritative as equivalent remote
checks. Ship the tested source and reuse its verified artifacts. Remote checks are required only
when they add coverage not exercised locally; a tag pointing at an already verified commit does
not require another complete suite.

Record the version, tested commit, applicable checks and outcomes, runtime environment and image
digest in the release notes. Confirm the tag targets the intended commit and check health,
readiness and the served artifact after deployment. Repeat affected checks when inputs change;
do not require separate full push, PR, master and tag runs or elaborate new proof packages for
each feature. Historical release records retain their original evidence and requirements.

## Version ownership

Use Git tags `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` for the combined server/web product. Cargo workspace package
versions track the next product candidate; keep the local
`grenadiers-core` dependency version aligned when changing them. Private npm package versions
remain `0.0.0`: they are build inputs and are not separately published or product release IDs.
The WebSocket `protocolVersion` is an independent compatibility contract, not a release number.

Each shipped feature PR bumps the product version and records its scope in `CHANGELOG.md`.
Use patch releases for bounded engineering increments; historical milestone labels are preserved
in the [plan archive](history/implementation-plan.md). Keep PRs focused on one behavior and its tests. Merge passing,
independently reviewed candidates, then publish the corresponding prerelease tag.
The repository gate checks that both local Cargo packages and their dependency agree.

### Release preparation helper

Stage the candidate notes under `CHANGELOG.md`'s Unreleased heading. Set `NEXT_VERSION` to the
chosen newer product version and `RELEASE_DATE` to its `YYYY-MM-DD` date, then preview:

```sh
node scripts/prepare-release.mjs --version "$NEXT_VERSION" --date "$RELEASE_DATE"
```

The default is a dry run. Add `--write` only after reviewing the plan; it updates the Cargo
workspace and local-package lock versions, then moves the Unreleased notes into the requested
dated release while retaining an empty Unreleased section. It does not run checks or perform
Git, tag, publish, or network operations. Run the applicable release checks separately.

## Candidate checklist

1. Update package metadata, lockfiles, contracts, and affected documentation intentionally.
2. Run the complete [release checklist](game/implementation-plan.md#release-checklist), including
   coverage, dependency audits, the image scan, real browser scenarios, and Compose/Kubernetes
   runtime checks. Record commands, results, image identity, and limitations in
   [verification.md](verification.md).
3. Obtain independent review of substantive changes. Commit a focused candidate and rerun
   affected checks if the reviewed source changes.
4. When publishing is authorized, tag that tested commit and promote the exact tested image;
   avoid rebuilding an unverified replacement under the release tag. Include supported rules,
   preview limits, and upgrade notes in the release notes.

## Current prerelease distribution

Current releases publish source tags and GitHub prerelease notes. Accepted image IDs in the
verification record identify locally tested artifacts; no production registry or hosted service
has been configured. A source prerelease does not claim a production deployment.

Evidence may name a clean candidate commit from before rebase or squash. Before merging,
compare its Docker build inputs with the final PR head, require the applicable local-first checks to pass,
and verify that the merged tree equals that head. Use the corresponding release tag for the
published source. Retain the accepted image when exact artifact reuse is required; a later
rebuild can receive different operating-system security updates and needs its own acceptance.

## Upgrade and rollback

The initial deployment uses one replica and `Recreate`. In-memory matches cannot survive
restart or rollback. Plan upgrades around active matches; a graceful stop publishes the final
interrupted state but cannot preserve process-local matches or credentials.
Keep the previous immutable image reference for rollback; database migration compatibility
must be designed when durable application data is introduced.

### Runtime operating-system refresh

Perform a controlled runtime refresh weekly and when a relevant Debian or runtime advisory
requires it. Keep the reviewed base digest and rebuild only the runtime stage without its cached
layer, following Buildx's
[`--no-cache-filter` contract](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/buildx/build/#no-cache-filter):

```sh
docker buildx build --no-cache-filter runtime --load --tag grenadiers:candidate-os-refresh .
```

Record the resulting exact image ID, scan that ID with the pinned release vulnerability scanner,
and run the applicable runtime acceptance against that same ID. Promote only the accepted ID and
retain the previous immutable image reference for rollback. The runtime stage intentionally runs
rolling Debian package updates, so a later build may resolve newer packages and is not expected to
be byte-identical; treat it as a new candidate with new evidence rather than reusing acceptance.

## v0.3.102 — 2026-10-28

[v0.3.102](https://github.com/liveweird/grenadiers/releases/tag/v0.3.102) enables 19 shared optional-item mechanics for three-/four-player headless states. Higher-seat regressions exercise equipment and timed effects, Wall Pass traversal, weapon placement, Oil collision/ignition, damage, remote bombs/mines, contention and recipient privacy. Punch, Bracelet and Teleporter remain explicitly gated in this release. See the [headless guide](game/multiplayer-core.md).

[Generator v3](game/multiplayer-generation.md) adds horizontal/vertical terrain/item symmetry, four protected corner exits, actual-round three-player corner omission and bounded fallback retaining the requested roster. Twelve-round coverage gives each three-player seat every corner three times. Historical generator sampling moved into a private helper without changing function bodies, draw order or v1/v2 golden results.

Checked immutable room configuration describes canonical 2–4 human/CPU seats, requires a human creator and pairs difficulty exactly with CPU presence. The domain recognizes 11×9, 13×11 and 15×13, but current generation explicitly rejects smaller boards. Live rooms, gameplay v13, CPU observations and replay remain two-player; no multiplayer or board selector is exposed yet.

Independent item, configuration and generation reviews are clear. Generation tests pass 93 cases, including legacy goldens; full core tests and additional higher-seat behavior regressions pass. Formatting, warnings-denied Clippy, source caps and repository checks pass. Unchanged two-player CPU behavior reuses the v0.3.101 64-case reference/replay acceptance; unchanged web/art/contracts/dependencies reuse their existing complete acceptance. No browser code or artwork changed.

Complete Rust acceptance passes on source `a8484ae0f051bb3c4ff340bc930f3e474bb50bc3`, tree `19a8229c76cd2fb05d3c90ee9e88be0fe3d69f43`: 645.624s, 28,207/30,614 lines (**92.1376%**), all 4,194,304 masks separately in debug/release/official coverage, 32 partitions, four workers, zero hidden retries and 37 raw profiles. Official LCOV was preserved before ending the source/target freeze. Unique Linux [run 40605790929](https://github.com/liveweird/grenadiers/actions/runs/40605790929) passes.

Exact image `sha256:08f8f136cb85681db7e882032522a502a1f7ab7d69dcefb6ea7a297b34120ced` passes pinned Trivy 0.74.0 with zero fixable HIGH/CRITICAL findings; Compose 10 browser cases/53.5s; Kubernetes 10/54.8s; CPU-item collection one/16.6s. Runtime security/resources, health/readiness/probes, Polish 320px controls and exact served HTML/JS/CSS/PNG identity pass. Temporary acceptance stacks were removed.

This is a source prerelease with a verified local image. Localhost runs the accepted image; v0.3.101 is retained for rollback. Deploy paired server/browser normally; no wire or replay migration is introduced. Outstanding work remains in the [backlog](../BACKLOG.md).
