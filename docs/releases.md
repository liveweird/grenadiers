# Releases

Planned release scope and work status live in the [backlog](../BACKLOG.md).
The [implementation plan](game/implementation-plan.md) defines the release checklist and future tracks.
A completed milestone is verification evidence; a release exists only after its tested commit
is tagged and its artifacts are published intentionally.

## Release verification policy

For this single-maintainer project, local checks are as authoritative as equivalent remote
checks. Ship the tested source and reuse its verified artifacts. Remote checks are required only
when they add coverage not exercised locally; a tag pointing at an already verified commit does
not require another complete suite.

Record the version, tested commit, applicable checks and outcomes, runtime environment and image
digest in the release notes. Confirm the tag targets the intended commit and check health,
readiness and the served artifact after deployment. Repeat affected checks when inputs change;
do not require separate full push, PR, master and tag runs or elaborate new proof packages for
each feature. Historical release records retain their original evidence and requirements.

## Version ownership

Use Git tags `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` for the combined server/web product. Cargo workspace package
versions track the next product candidate; keep the local
`grenadiers-core` dependency version aligned when changing them. Private npm package versions
remain `0.0.0`: they are build inputs and are not separately published or product release IDs.
The WebSocket `protocolVersion` is an independent compatibility contract, not a release number.

Each shipped feature PR bumps the product version and records its scope in `CHANGELOG.md`.
Use patch releases for bounded engineering increments; historical milestone labels are preserved
in the [plan archive](history/implementation-plan.md). Keep PRs focused on one behavior and its tests. Merge passing,
independently reviewed candidates. Publish stable tags for accepted milestones and label previews
as prereleases.
The repository gate checks that both local Cargo packages and their dependency agree.

### Release preparation helper

Stage the candidate notes under `CHANGELOG.md`'s Unreleased heading. Set `NEXT_VERSION` to the
chosen newer product version and `RELEASE_DATE` to its `YYYY-MM-DD` date, then preview:

```sh
node scripts/prepare-release.mjs --version "$NEXT_VERSION" --date "$RELEASE_DATE"
```

The default is a dry run. Add `--write` only after reviewing the plan; it updates the Cargo
workspace and local-package lock versions, then moves the Unreleased notes into the requested
dated release while retaining an empty Unreleased section. It does not run checks or perform
Git, tag, publish, or network operations. Run the applicable release checks separately.

## Candidate checklist

1. Update package metadata, lockfiles, contracts, and affected documentation intentionally.
2. Run the complete [release checklist](game/implementation-plan.md#release-checklist), including
   coverage, dependency audits, the image scan, real browser scenarios, and Compose/Kubernetes
   runtime checks. Record commands, results, image identity, and limitations in
   [verification.md](verification.md).
3. Obtain independent review of substantive changes. Commit a focused candidate and rerun
   affected checks if the reviewed source changes.
4. When publishing is authorized, tag that tested commit and promote the exact tested image;
   avoid rebuilding an unverified replacement under the release tag. Include supported rules,
   preview limits, and upgrade notes in the release notes.

## Current release distribution

Current releases publish source tags and GitHub release notes. Version 1.0.0 is the first stable
game milestone. Accepted image IDs identify locally tested artifacts; no production registry
or hosted service has been configured. A stable source release does not claim a hosted deployment.

Evidence may name a clean candidate commit from before rebase or squash. Before merging,
compare its Docker build inputs with the final PR head, require the applicable local-first checks to pass,
and verify that the merged tree equals that head. Use the corresponding release tag for the
published source. Retain the accepted image when exact artifact reuse is required; a later
rebuild can receive different operating-system security updates and needs its own acceptance.

## Upgrade and rollback

The initial deployment uses one replica and `Recreate`. In-memory matches cannot survive
restart or rollback. Plan upgrades around active matches; a graceful stop publishes the final
interrupted state but cannot preserve process-local matches or credentials.
Keep the previous immutable image reference for rollback; database migration compatibility
must be designed when durable application data is introduced.

### Runtime operating-system refresh

Perform a controlled runtime refresh weekly and when a relevant Debian or runtime advisory
requires it. Keep the reviewed base digest and rebuild only the runtime stage without its cached
layer, following Buildx's
[`--no-cache-filter` contract](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/buildx/build/#no-cache-filter):

```sh
docker buildx build --no-cache-filter runtime --load --tag grenadiers:candidate-os-refresh .
```

Record the resulting exact image ID, scan that ID with the pinned release vulnerability scanner,
and run the applicable runtime acceptance against that same ID. Promote only the accepted ID and
retain the previous immutable image reference for rollback. The runtime stage intentionally runs
rolling Debian package updates, so a later build may resolve newer packages and is not expected to
be byte-identical; treat it as a new candidate with new evidence rather than reusing acceptance.

## v1.2.1 — 2026-10-31

Public fire now warms nearby terrain and characters. A persistent four-light pool, six-frame
pixel flames, brief local ignition, embers and smoke improve depth while retaining clear hazard
footprints. Reduced motion keeps static fire and illumination. Existing artist pixels are unchanged.

WebGL recovery now restores the clear colour, atlas upload and shadows after Three rebuilds its
caches; frozen before/after images match exactly. See [the renderer guide](game/arena-3d.md).

### Verification

Accepted source: `993f2342ffe9aaf7c5ee34a33fbfa575c1fdfd14`,
[PR #301](https://github.com/liveweird/grenadiers/pull/301).
Independent reviews cover public-only lighting, bounded resources, reset/reduced-motion behavior,
artist-frame preservation and the current-validator optimization. Expired ignition slots release
before later bursts; admission into existing fire cannot replay old explosions.

- Full web: 7,363 tests in 164 files. Coverage: 95.40% lines, 92.30% statements,
  91.43% functions and 88.62% branches; all floors remain unchanged. Types, lint, Knip,
  generated-validator drift and 115 documented browser scenarios pass.
- Native Three: 23 passed with 11 project-specific skips; two strict context-recovery cases
  and two final lighting/animation cases pass. Artist workbench: 11 passed.
- A warmed 40-frame diagnostic measures render-callback submission cost, not hardware FPS:
  empty median/p95/max 0.20/0.30/0.30ms; worst public fire 1.70/2.10/2.40ms.
- The hard bundle budgets remain unchanged: JavaScript 397,119/400,000 gzip bytes,
  CSS 15,430/20,000. Only gameplay18 adopts shared canonical Ajv code-generation options;
  boolean acceptance and exact ordered compiler parity pass. Internal schema paths change
  as documented in [ADR 0022](decisions/0022-standalone-browser-validation.md).
  Archived validators remain byte-identical.
- Exact-image Compose duel/authentication and a fresh all-on three-CPU match pass, with
  physical CPU movement and bomb placement. Kubernetes duel/authentication and restricted
  runtime checks pass. Owned acceptance stacks and namespace are removed.
- Pinned Trivy 0.74 reports zero fixable HIGH/CRITICAL findings. Every image web file equals
  the verified build. Backend source, contracts and dependency versions are unchanged;
  reuse v1.2.0 Rust debug/release, coverage, dependency and distinct Linux acceptance.
  The metadata-only duplicate Linux run 41235509963 was cancelled under local-first policy.

### Operation and artist handoff

Accepted local image:
`sha256:27406a134593ae5d81316df71e93e3ee8a9df0ec0a47d1bcbfd1b9457c927dd1`,
version 1.2.1/source 993f2342, tagged `grenadiers:fire-v121`. Reload browser tabs after upgrading;
process-local matches cannot survive a server restart. The previous v1.2.0 image remains available
for rollback. Gameplay stays on protocol18/rules10/CPU26.

The [v1.2.1 artist bundle](https://github.com/liveweird/grenadiers/releases/download/v1.2.1/grenadiers-artist-v1.2.1.zip)
contains 205 files: canonical PNG/JSON, separate guides, overview, 192 runtime slices and native
fire previews. The source grows to 1120×2240, with 196 assigned entries (192 drawings and four
blank reservations), plus four free cells. Slots 189–195 append four flame poses, ember, smoke
and ignition. Decoded comparison preserves 9,524,224 old RGBA bytes outside new rectangles and
446,464 transparent new-row gutter bytes without differences; all 189 prior frame descriptors
are identical. The runtime atlas remains within its existing 16MiB decoded texture budget.
