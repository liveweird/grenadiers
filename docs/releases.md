# Releases

Release labels and scope live in the [implementation plan](game/implementation-plan.md).
A completed milestone is verification evidence; a release exists only after its tested commit
is tagged and its artifacts are published intentionally.

## Release verification policy

For this single-maintainer project, local checks are as authoritative as equivalent remote
checks. Ship the tested source and reuse its verified artifacts. Remote checks are required only
when they add coverage not exercised locally; a tag pointing at an already verified commit does
not require another complete suite.

Record the version, tested commit, applicable checks and outcomes, runtime environment and image
digest in the release notes. Confirm the tag targets the intended commit and check health,
readiness and the served artifact after deployment. Repeat affected checks when inputs change;
do not require separate full push, PR, master and tag runs or elaborate new proof packages for
each feature. Historical release records retain their original evidence and requirements.

## Version ownership

Use Git tags `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` for the combined server/web product. Cargo workspace package
versions track the next product candidate; keep the local
`grenadiers-core` dependency version aligned when changing them. Private npm package versions
remain `0.0.0`: they are build inputs and are not separately published or product release IDs.
The WebSocket `protocolVersion` is an independent compatibility contract, not a release number.

Each shipped feature PR bumps the product version and records its scope in `CHANGELOG.md`.
Use patch releases within the current milestone for bounded engineering increments.
`0.2.0` is the first playable duel preview; `0.3.0` adds classic match progression. Subsequent
`0.3.x` increments stage reconnect support and activate it at `0.3.9`; `0.4.0` remains the resilient playtest milestone. Keep PRs focused on one behavior and its tests. Merge passing,
independently reviewed candidates, then publish the corresponding prerelease tag.
The repository gate checks that both local Cargo packages and their dependency agree.

## Candidate checklist

1. Update package metadata, lockfiles, contracts, and affected documentation intentionally.
2. Run the complete [release checklist](game/implementation-plan.md#release-checklist), including
   coverage, dependency audits, the image scan, real browser scenarios, and Compose/Kubernetes
   runtime checks. Record commands, results, image identity, and limitations in
   [verification.md](verification.md).
3. Obtain independent review of substantive changes. Commit a focused candidate and rerun
   affected checks if the reviewed source changes.
4. When publishing is authorized, tag that tested commit and promote the exact tested image;
   avoid rebuilding an unverified replacement under the release tag. Include supported rules,
   preview limits, and upgrade notes in the release notes.

## Current prerelease distribution

Current releases publish source tags and GitHub prerelease notes. Accepted image IDs in the
verification record identify locally tested artifacts; no production registry or hosted service
has been configured. A source prerelease does not claim a production deployment.

Evidence may name a clean candidate commit from before rebase or squash. Before merging,
compare its Docker build inputs with the final PR head, require every configured push/PR check to pass,
and verify that the merged tree equals that head. Use the corresponding release tag for the
published source. Retain the accepted image when exact artifact reuse is required; a later
rebuild can receive different operating-system security updates and needs its own acceptance.

## Upgrade and rollback

The initial deployment uses one replica and `Recreate`. In-memory matches cannot survive
restart or rollback. Plan upgrades around active matches; a graceful stop publishes the final
interrupted state but cannot preserve process-local matches or credentials.
Keep the previous immutable image reference for rollback; database migration compatibility
must be designed when durable application data is introduced.

## v0.3.63 — 2026-10-25

[v0.3.63](https://github.com/liveweird/grenadiers/releases/tag/v0.3.63) separates authentication
from the nine sequenced commands before dispatch. Authenticated dispatch now accepts a private
sequenced type, preserving high-water advancement before semantic checks, error correlation,
quotas, admission ownership and every close sequence. Gameplay and diagnostics share the same
five-second per-frame send policy; whole final-delivery sequences retain their independent outer
budget. No wire, schema, replay, dependency or client behavior changes.

Independent review and focused real-socket regressions pass, including all nine pre-auth command
variants, semantic-failure sequence consumption, reauthentication closure and distinct counters.
Fresh source-bound Rust acceptance at `c8cc672812ea04d74a074a9570c9f473bd91dd62` completes every
4,194,304 mask in debug, release and official coverage in 428.571s with zero retries. Each ordinary
profile passes 930 core / 307 server tests plus two doctests; four existing performance cases
remain ignored. Coverage is 17,514/18,719 lines (93.56%) at the 90% floor. Rustfmt, Clippy,
runner/repository checks and [Linux units](https://github.com/liveweird/grenadiers/actions/runs/40237196707) pass.

Integrated image source `c50773d764ea0fd897de809de746719f9a7cde8e` has identical Rust inputs and
the unchanged v0.3.62 web tree. Accepted image is
`sha256:efa9be5a847ed7334388b1129a6be980e5df5fe25c72fc3d7d7620bc9dfc87f9`.
The image passes eight native Compose cases and eight Kubernetes cases, with exact image,
security/probes/resources/origin/CSP/cache and readiness checks. A fresh pinned image scan reports
zero fixable HIGH/CRITICAL findings. Reuse v0.3.62 web acceptance and unchanged dependency audits.

Localhost:8085 serves the accepted image. Runtime security, health/readiness, CSP/cache and exact
HTML/JavaScript/atlas equality with accepted unchanged assets pass, plus one fresh native
authentication smoke. Temporary acceptance resources are removed. Control is
`.local-checkpoints/runtime/compose-v0.3.63.yaml`; `rollback-v0.3.62.yaml` retains the prior image.
There is no migration. Core admission argument grouping and other remaining review work stay
separate; CPU implementation remains deferred.
