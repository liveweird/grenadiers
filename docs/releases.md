# Releases

Planned release scope and work status live in the [backlog](../BACKLOG.md).
The [implementation plan](game/implementation-plan.md) defines the release checklist and future tracks.
A completed milestone is verification evidence; a release exists only after its tested commit
is tagged and its artifacts are published intentionally.

## Release verification policy

For this single-maintainer project, local checks are as authoritative as equivalent remote
checks. Ship the tested source and reuse its verified artifacts. Remote checks are required only
when they add coverage not exercised locally; a tag pointing at an already verified commit does
not require another complete suite.

Record the version, tested commit, applicable checks and outcomes, runtime environment and image
digest in the release notes. Confirm the tag targets the intended commit and check health,
readiness and the served artifact after deployment. Repeat affected checks when inputs change;
do not require separate full push, PR, master and tag runs or elaborate new proof packages for
each feature. Historical release records retain their original evidence and requirements.

## Version ownership

Use Git tags `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` for the combined server/web product. Cargo workspace package
versions track the next product candidate; keep the local
`grenadiers-core` dependency version aligned when changing them. Private npm package versions
remain `0.0.0`: they are build inputs and are not separately published or product release IDs.
The WebSocket `protocolVersion` is an independent compatibility contract, not a release number.

Each shipped feature PR bumps the product version and records its scope in `CHANGELOG.md`.
Use patch releases for bounded engineering increments; historical milestone labels are preserved
in the [plan archive](history/implementation-plan.md). Keep PRs focused on one behavior and its tests. Merge passing,
independently reviewed candidates, then publish the corresponding prerelease tag.
The repository gate checks that both local Cargo packages and their dependency agree.

### Release preparation helper

Stage the candidate notes under `CHANGELOG.md`'s Unreleased heading. Set `NEXT_VERSION` to the
chosen newer product version and `RELEASE_DATE` to its `YYYY-MM-DD` date, then preview:

```sh
node scripts/prepare-release.mjs --version "$NEXT_VERSION" --date "$RELEASE_DATE"
```

The default is a dry run. Add `--write` only after reviewing the plan; it updates the Cargo
workspace and local-package lock versions, then moves the Unreleased notes into the requested
dated release while retaining an empty Unreleased section. It does not run checks or perform
Git, tag, publish, or network operations. Run the applicable release checks separately.

## Candidate checklist

1. Update package metadata, lockfiles, contracts, and affected documentation intentionally.
2. Run the complete [release checklist](game/implementation-plan.md#release-checklist), including
   coverage, dependency audits, the image scan, real browser scenarios, and Compose/Kubernetes
   runtime checks. Record commands, results, image identity, and limitations in
   [verification.md](verification.md).
3. Obtain independent review of substantive changes. Commit a focused candidate and rerun
   affected checks if the reviewed source changes.
4. When publishing is authorized, tag that tested commit and promote the exact tested image;
   avoid rebuilding an unverified replacement under the release tag. Include supported rules,
   preview limits, and upgrade notes in the release notes.

## Current prerelease distribution

Current releases publish source tags and GitHub prerelease notes. Accepted image IDs in the
verification record identify locally tested artifacts; no production registry or hosted service
has been configured. A source prerelease does not claim a production deployment.

Evidence may name a clean candidate commit from before rebase or squash. Before merging,
compare its Docker build inputs with the final PR head, require the applicable local-first checks to pass,
and verify that the merged tree equals that head. Use the corresponding release tag for the
published source. Retain the accepted image when exact artifact reuse is required; a later
rebuild can receive different operating-system security updates and needs its own acceptance.

## Upgrade and rollback

The initial deployment uses one replica and `Recreate`. In-memory matches cannot survive
restart or rollback. Plan upgrades around active matches; a graceful stop publishes the final
interrupted state but cannot preserve process-local matches or credentials.
Keep the previous immutable image reference for rollback; database migration compatibility
must be designed when durable application data is introduced.

### Runtime operating-system refresh

Perform a controlled runtime refresh weekly and when a relevant Debian or runtime advisory
requires it. Keep the reviewed base digest and rebuild only the runtime stage without its cached
layer, following Buildx's
[`--no-cache-filter` contract](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/buildx/build/#no-cache-filter):

```sh
docker buildx build --no-cache-filter runtime --load --tag grenadiers:candidate-os-refresh .
```

Record the resulting exact image ID, scan that ID with the pinned release vulnerability scanner,
and run the applicable runtime acceptance against that same ID. Promote only the accepted ID and
retain the previous immutable image reference for rollback. The runtime stage intentionally runs
rolling Debian package updates, so a later build may resolve newer packages and is not expected to
be byte-identical; treat it as a new candidate with new evidence rather than reusing acceptance.

## v0.3.96 — 2026-10-27

[v0.3.96](https://github.com/liveweird/grenadiers/releases/tag/v0.3.96) adds a guarded held-Punch tactic. One stopped Equipment action has a common certified escape for relocation and a no-op, preserving the original bomb identity and absolute fuse. The narrow scene requires a centered CPU, one adjacent Standard timed bomb, no exposed pickups/Oil/flames and a visible rival without bomb-moving equipment. New incompatible observations withdraw the route. Manual player controls remain unchanged.

A recipient-footprint barrier follows the authoritative bomb collision rule: only the named bomb’s motion uncertainty at the continuously occupied origin is waived; lethal checks remain and leaving the cell consumes the exception. Exact basis+6 admission/basis+7 execution and typed manual rejection preserve the checked schedule without retry or legacy Bomb escape. Optional proof work uses at most half of the remaining global allowance. UtilityV14 retains V1–V13 replay identities and wire v12.

Focused tests cover geometry, timing, branch identity and complete physical routes through fuse/flame expiry. A core-private fixture compares ready/cooling histories with identical observations; a queued Driver fixture covers accepted/rejected Equipment in a Kick-enabled ruleset. These compose cooldown and queue coverage; the Driver fixture does not create bomb motion or combine accepted input with private cooldown. Crafted replacement-state fixtures do not claim generated-world replay. Independent review, formatting, Clippy, repository/tooling checks and the 400-line ceiling pass.

Both 16-case matrices replay exactly with unchanged per-case trajectories, outcomes, calls and work versus v0.3.95: 594/4,010 calls, 17,958,825/89,659,046 work units and a 65,536 maximum. Opening cases remain alive/censored; full rounds retain 15 timeout draws and the same CPU win. Isolated host observations were 2.38s opening and 12.13s full; planner p95/max were 3.995/5.248ms and 3.756/4.973ms. These are reference observations, not a strength or performance guarantee.

One exhaustive server gate passes on source `27d074ca5c83544a12b5a31cd97ae410b036b6f5` (tree `a6d3e77e7c95118583b4a75dc2ecb1356222e065`): 521.69s, 27,100/29,389 lines (**92.2114%**), all 4,194,304 masks separately in debug/release/official coverage, 32 partitions/four workers/zero hidden retries and 37 raw profiles. Official LCOV was preserved before releasing the source/target freeze. Unique Linux [run 40583437112](https://github.com/liveweird/grenadiers/actions/runs/40583437112) passes.

Exact image `sha256:5d967f51f91aaea9361cea8dc0878fb7332d37e980c2aeb3ff0ccf38b0f32b15` passes pinned Trivy 0.74.0 with zero fixable HIGH/CRITICAL findings, Compose 10 cases/51.4s, Kubernetes 10 cases/53.0s, CPU-item collection 1 case/15.6s, Polish 320px, served-asset identity and runtime security/resources/probes. The initial scanner configuration-digest lookup failed; the corrected immutable-image scan is retained separately. Temporary stacks were removed. Unchanged frontend/API/art/E2E/tooling/external dependency inputs retain accepted full-web 6,874 tests/97 files and static/audit checks.

This source prerelease has a verified local image; no production registry publication is claimed. Localhost runs the accepted image with v0.3.95 retained for rollback. CPU4 difficulty, broader tactics and human validation remain in the [backlog](../BACKLOG.md#single-player).
