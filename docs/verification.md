# Repository verification

## M2A owned bomb placement — 2026-10-17

The placement increment passes `scripts/gates.sh server` with **63 core unit tests,
9 server tests, and 1 public API doctest**. The unchanged Rust coverage gate passes at
**990/1,083 lines, 91.41%**. No dependencies, wire contracts, frontend behavior, or deployment
manifests change. Independent review found no remaining actionable issues after constructor
regression coverage and the retired obstacle API documentation were corrected.

Tests exercise post-movement cells, ownership/range/deadline snapshots, derived capacity,
same-cell conflicts, invalid-request isolation, ordered cancellation, all-actor exit grace,
ID/deadline exhaustion, and reconstruction from a nonempty owned-bomb world. Actor IDs at
`u32::MAX` do not exhaust lower unused bomb IDs. Fuse execution and damage remain deferred.


Runtime verification uses candidate image
`sha256:62a27015d91eabda211e4ce038fb5782521e9dbc5446cfb6e6d8b55b91c89233`:

- Compose starts without PostgreSQL; health/readiness return 200. The actual two-context
  WebSocket/Axe browser scenario passes against the built app.
- The same image rolls out ready in local Kubernetes. Health/readiness, SPA fallback,
  unknown API 404, and the browser scenario pass through the Service port-forward.
- Strict rendered Kubernetes validation passes: 3 valid resources, no errors or skips.
- Digest-pinned Trivy 0.74.0 passes the unchanged fixable HIGH/CRITICAL filter with zero
  findings. The local scan reads a `docker image save` archive through `--input` and a
  read-only archive mount, without exposing the Docker socket to the scanner container.
- A clean Git-tree export builds successfully; its runtime filesystem layers exactly match
  the tested candidate. Attestation/manifest identities can differ between builds.
- Temporary Compose containers, Kubernetes namespace, port-forward, and scan archive
  are removed after verification; local images remain available.

## M1 world and movement — 2026-10-17

The integrated headless domain passes `scripts/gates.sh server`: exact repository pins,
400-line source ceiling, rustfmt, Clippy with warnings denied, locked tests, and build.
Tests pass: **49 core unit tests, 9 server regression tests, and 1 public API doctest**.
`scripts/gates.sh coverage` passes the unchanged 80% line floor with **825/916 lines, 90.07%**.

Evidence includes all five movement speeds, exact obstacle faces, corner gliding, multi-tick
turn correction and cancellation, held-input priority, actor overlap, bomb exemption exit/re-entry,
stationary/piecewise traces, invalid-coordinate rejection, atomic errors, and repeated logs
producing equal full states. Independent review found no remaining actionable issues after
the reported defects and evidence gaps were fixed.

M1 adds no dependencies and changes no wire contracts, browser behavior, or deployment manifests.
The diagnostic UI remains the browser experience. Combat and rendered gameplay are future
milestones; [ADR 0003](decisions/0003-arena-rendering.md) records the PixiJS direction for M3.

## M0 foundation — 2026-10-16

Verified locally on **2026-10-16**, macOS ARM64 with OrbStack Docker/Kubernetes.
Earlier network/socket/Git denials were resolved through permitted sandbox escalation.
This record covers the diagnostic scaffold; gameplay is not implemented.

### Required gates

| Check | Observed result |
| --- | --- |
| `scripts/gates.sh all` | Passed: repository pins/source sizes, locked Rust fmt/Clippy/tests/build, contracts, web lint/Knip/coverage/build, E2E static checks. |
| Rust tests | 11 passed (2 core, 9 server), including real ephemeral WebSocket sockets. |
| `scripts/gates.sh coverage` | Passed unchanged 80% line floor: **214/265 lines, 80.75%**. Core 100%; server library 93.37%; binary entry point 0%. |
| Web tests | **7 files, 29 tests passed**, including generated-type compilation, Spectral rule enforcement, and rendered Kubernetes invariants. |
| Web coverage | 95.34% statements, 90% branches, 100% functions, 96.05% lines; configured floors remain 85%. |
| `scripts/gates.sh security` | Passed. cargo-deny advisories/bans/licenses/sources passed; both npm audits reported **zero vulnerabilities**. |
| `scripts/gates.sh k8s` | Passed rendered invariants and strict schemas: 3 resources valid, none invalid, errored, or skipped. |
| `scripts/gates.sh browser` | Passed against both Compose and Kubernetes Service port-forward: two independent browser contexts, real WebSocket roundtrips, disconnected/connected Axe checks. |
| CI-configured Trivy scan | Passed: no fixable HIGH/CRITICAL findings under the configured filter. Debian runtime scanning complements Rust/npm dependency checks. |

Tools: Rust **1.99.1**, Node **24.21.0**, cargo-llvm-cov **0.9.1**, cargo-deny
**0.20.2**, kubeconform **0.8.0**, kubectl **1.33.9**, Docker **29.8.2**, and
digest-pinned Trivy **0.74.0**. Kubernetes schemas target **1.33.0** as configured in CI.

### Runtime evidence

- `docker compose build app` built the locked Rust/React image. Rust and runtime base-image
  manifest indexes are now resolved and pinned. Runtime apt security updates repaired the
  inherited `perl-base` findings; no audit threshold or scanner policy was weakened.
- A clean staged Git-tree export built successfully using Docker's layer cache. Its runtime
  filesystem layers match the tested image, without relying on untracked local source files.
- The final tested image is
  `sha256:97aec4259fd0f931e92080d504fd389cc740c32a938b7f8a9b863b93dc89e2fe`.
  Kubernetes reported that same image digest, a successful rollout, and a ready container.
- The database-free app started successfully. Configured local PostgreSQL readiness returned
  200; stopping that database changed readiness to 503 Problem JSON while liveness stayed 200;
  restarting PostgreSQL restored readiness to 200.
- Through the Kubernetes Service port-forward, health/readiness returned 200 with `no-store`,
  an unknown frontend route returned the SPA index, and an unknown API route returned 404
  Problem JSON. Browser execution also loaded the actual built assets.
- Independent review covered the generator, rendered-manifest guardrails, Rust/configuration
  fixes, Spectral wrapper, dependency changes, and contrast correction. Reported defects were
  fixed and regression-tested; no actionable findings remain in those reviewed changes.
- Temporary Compose containers/database volume, Kubernetes namespace, and port-forward were
  removed after verification. The locally built images remain available for development.

### Reproduce

Install the pinned tools described in [testing.md](testing.md) and
[deployment.md](deployment.md), then run:

```sh
npm --prefix web ci
npm --prefix e2e ci
scripts/gates.sh all
scripts/gates.sh coverage
scripts/gates.sh security
scripts/gates.sh k8s
docker compose up --build -d
npm --prefix e2e run install:browsers
scripts/gates.sh browser
docker compose down
```

Use the exact scanner command in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for the image scan. Deploy the
same tested image using [deployment.md](deployment.md), port-forward the Service to 8085,
and rerun the browser gate. No game, load, multi-node, or recovery guarantee follows from
these scaffold checks. These are local results; hosted CI status is separate evidence.

The original `AGENTS.md` remains unchanged under the explicit preservation instruction;
current engineering conventions live in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
